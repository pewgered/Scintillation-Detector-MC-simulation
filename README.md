# Scintillation-Detector-MC-simulation

The documentation of this project is written in hungarian!

One of my first bigger university projects, in the field of physics was a Monte Carlo simulation of a scintillation detector. The simulation used real cross section data to sample free path and interaction of gamma photons. The source of the photon was a isotropic point source, the detector was a homogeneous NaI cylinder. The possible interaction were: absorption, (isotropic) incoherent scatter and pair production. The output of the program was usually a gamma spectrum.
